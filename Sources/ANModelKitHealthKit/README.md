# ANModelKitHealthKit

This module provides integration with Apple's HealthKit Medications API introduced in iOS 26.

## Important Note

**The HealthKit Medications API (iOS 26) is currently in development and not yet publicly available.**

This module contains the architecture and interfaces for HealthKit integration based on:
- WWDC 2025 Session: "Meet the HealthKit Medications API"
- iOS 26 Beta documentation

The actual implementation contains placeholder methods that will be updated when the API becomes publicly available in future Xcode releases.

## Current Status

✅ **Implemented:**
- Core model extensions with HealthKit-compatible properties
- Authorization management structure
- Query helper interfaces
- Sync manager architecture
- Bidirectional conversion patterns
- Comprehensive documentation

⏳ **Pending (requires iOS 26 SDK):**
- Actual HKMedicationDoseEvent implementation
- HKUserAnnotatedMedication implementation
- HKMedicationConcept implementation
- Query descriptor execution
- Per-object authorization

## Usage

Once iOS 26 SDK is available, you'll be able to use this module as documented in the main README.

## Development Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Architecture and interfaces
2. **Phase 2 (iOS 26 Beta)**: Implementation with beta SDK
3. **Phase 3 (iOS 26 Release)**: Production-ready release

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests for:
- Core model enhancements (works now)
- HealthKit integration (will work with iOS 26 SDK)
